Hello User of my Repository.

You landed on the repository for LiquidDisenchant.
LiquidDisenchant is a plugin for HonorBuddy, a World of Warcraft bot.
This is a trivial little addon that disenchants your Uncommon Quality BoE items.

Whenever you loot a Uncommon Quality BoE item, LiquidDisenchant will kick in and DE the item.
This way your bags will not be flooded, and you end up with a nice few stacks of mats.
With little modifications you can also set it to DE soulbound items or blue items if you so prefer.

Any bugs? Report em on the forums in the LiquidDisenchant topic.

Thanks, LiquidAtoR.
